It's a project created to show some basic Android Programming topics. The idea is develop an useful app with real challenges that you need to accept when you are developing an Android app. Step by Step you are going to see how to build a product following the best practices. First of all, we need to define the UI with mockups then based on it create Activities using mocked data to code the logic, as a final step,  we're going to create a Rest client to get real data to use along with Activities, Services and other components that we already created.
